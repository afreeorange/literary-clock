A 24-Hour Literary Clock
========================

Shows a with a quote for (almost) every minute of the day. Inspired by [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/).

Sources

* Jaap Meijers' [annotated CSV](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/)
* [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/table/2011/apr/21/literary-clock). For the first version. Realized that Meijer's CSV had more quotes _and_ was annotated ðŸ¤˜

### Notes

Some cleanup and hand-editing was necessary for ~150 annotations. Python's `fuzzywuzzy` didn't seem like it would help. The `csv` module didn't appear to capture all the quotes so ended up doing a `string.split` on "`|`".
