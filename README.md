A 24-Hour Literary Clock
========================

Shows a 24-hour clock with a quote for every minute. Quotes were pulled from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/table/2011/apr/21/literary-clock) and turned into JSON with [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/). Inspired by [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/).
